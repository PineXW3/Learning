# My Project

## Description
This Trie Tree Project is build for my learning purposes.  
I built it to study how to implement and use tries and its operations.  
I think this is a great way to study and learn.

## Challenge Encountered
The deleteWord operation in tries is the hardest function I encountered throughout the project.  
It's a very logic dense function, and I spent plenty of time to get through.  
I even drew a mind map to understand and implement it.

## Conclusion
Overall I think it's great, because it's different to see others codes than implementing it by yourself.
